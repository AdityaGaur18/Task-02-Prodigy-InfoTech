 # Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis

## Overview
This project performs data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to understand key factors influencing passenger survival.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Steps
- Cleaned missing and irrelevant data
- Analyzed survival patterns across gender, age, passenger class, and family size
- Visualized distributions and correlations

## Key Insights
- Females had significantly higher survival rates
- First-class passengers were more likely to survive
- Children and passengers with small families had better survival chances
- Higher fare correlated with higher survival probability

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how structured data cleaning and exploratory analysis can uncover meaningful patterns even without advanced modeling.
Through EDA, we identified key factors such as gender, passenger class, age, and family size that significantly influenced survival on the Titanic.

The analysis highlights the importance of:

- Cleaning and preparing data before modeling

- Using visualizations to validate assumptions

- Translating raw data into actionable insights

This notebook serves as a strong example of foundational data analysis skills and can be extended further with feature engineering and predictive modeling.
